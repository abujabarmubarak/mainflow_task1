📊 Student Performance Analysis - MainFlow Task 1
🔍 Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The task focuses on analyzing student performance data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

📂 Dataset
Dataset Name: student-mat.csv
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Features Include:
Grades: G1, G2, G3 (Term-wise grades)
Study Time: Weekly study hours
Gender: Male/Female
Other Factors: Family support, internet access, parental education, etc.
✅ Tasks Completed
✔ Data Loading & Cleaning – Handled missing values, removed duplicates
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Checked dataset size, types, and distribution
✔ Statistical Insights:

Calculated average final grade (G3)
Counted students scoring above 15 in G3
Analyzed correlation between study time and final grade
Compared male vs. female average grades
✔ Data Visualization:
Histogram of final grades
Scatter plot of study time vs. G3
Bar chart of male vs. female student performance
